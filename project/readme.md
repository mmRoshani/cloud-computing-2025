# Project: Automated MLOps Platform with Ray

## 1. Project Overview

# Automated MLOps Platform with Ray

## Overview

This project delivers a web-based MLOps platform that empowers users—including non-experts—to:

- Upload or select datasets from MinIO (S3-compatible storage)
- Choose or define machine learning models (e.g., CNN for MNIST)
- Set or auto-tune hyperparameters
- Launch distributed training jobs on Ray clusters (with GPU/CPU support)
- Monitor training progress and resource usage in real time
- Track experiments and models with MLflow
- Package, version, and serve trained models via APIs
- Monitor models in production for performance and data drift
- Trigger retraining and manage model versions with full history and rollback

All features are accessed through a **Django-powered web GUI**. The backend orchestrates all technical workflows, so users do not need to interact directly with Ray, Docker, or the underlying infrastructure.

---

## System Architecture

The platform consists of the following core components:


| Component | Role |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Django** | Provides the main web GUI and orchestrates workflows. Handles user authentication, project management, and triggers backend processes (e.g., launching training jobs, monitoring, serving models). |
| **Ray** | Executes distributed training, hyperparameter tuning (Ray Tune), and model serving (Ray Serve). Each user/job gets a dedicated Ray cluster, provisioned via Docker with GPU/CPU support as needed. |
| **MinIO** | S3-compatible object storage for datasets, model artifacts, and logs. Users upload/select data here; Ray jobs read/write directly to MinIO. |
| **RabbitMQ** | Decouples job submission from execution. Django submits jobs to RabbitMQ; backend workers listen for jobs and launch Ray clusters. Enables asynchronous, scalable processing. |
| **MLflow** | Tracks experiments, logs hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts. Provides a searchable model registry with versioning and lineage. |
| **Docker** | Containerizes Ray clusters and model serving APIs, ensuring reproducible, isolated environments with GPU/CPU compatibility. |
| **Prometheus** | Collects metrics (training loss, accuracy, resource usage, inference latency) from Ray clusters and serving APIs. |
| **Grafana** | Visualizes metrics from Prometheus. Provides dashboards for users and admins to monitor training and serving in real time. |
| **Ray Dashboard** | Native Ray UI for monitoring clusters, jobs, and resources. Useful for advanced users and debugging. |
| **N8n** | Workflow automation for notifications (e.g., drift alerts), retraining triggers, and integration with external tools (email, Slack, ticketing). |

## Workflow: User Journey

1. **User logs in via Django GUI.**
2. **User creates/selects a project and dataset** (from MinIO or uploads new data).
3. **User selects a model architecture** (template or custom).
4. **User sets or auto-tunes hyperparameters** (manual or via Ray Tune).
5. **Job submission and Ray cluster provisioning** (Django → RabbitMQ → Ray cluster via Docker).
6. **Distributed training and real-time monitoring** (metrics to Prometheus, dashboards in Grafana).
7. **Experiment tracking and model registration** (MLflow).
8. **Model packaging and API deployment** (Docker container, Ray Serve).
9. **Model performance monitoring** (Prometheus, Grafana).
10. **Data drift detection and retraining automation** (N8n, MLflow versioning).

## Example User Story

> A data scientist logs in, creates a project, selects MNIST from MinIO, chooses a CNN model, clicks “Auto-tune,” submits the job, watches training in Grafana, reviews results in MLflow, deploys the model via API, and monitors drift. When drift is detected, retraining is triggered and a new model version is deployed automatically.
